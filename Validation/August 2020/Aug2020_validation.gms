Description: This model was developed to qaunitfy the trade-off between number of steady low flow days and hydropower revenue objectives.
            The model has 2 periods per day (i.e. pHigh and plow) and runs for a month. we have used linear programming to solve the problem.
            All the structural and operational constraints applied here are uptodate.
